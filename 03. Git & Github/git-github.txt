# Configure tooling
    - Configure user information for all local repositories

    1. $ git config --global user.email "[email address]"
        - Sets the email you want attached to your commit transactions

    2. $ git config --global user.name "[name]"
        - Sets the name you want attached to your commit transactions




# Create Repositories
    - When starting out with a new repository, you only need to do it 
      once; either locally, then push to GitHub, or by cloning an 
      existing repository.

     1. $ git init
          - Turn an existing directory into a git repository

     2. $ git clone [url]
          - Clone (download) a repository that already exists on 
            GitHub, including all of the files, branches, and commits




# The .gitgnore file
    - Sometimes it may be a good idea to exclude files from being 
      tracked with Git.





# Branches
   -  Any commits you make will be made on the branch you're currently 
      “checked out” to. Use git status to see which branch that is.


    1. $ git branch [branch-name]
        - Creates a new branch
   
    2. git branch -d [branch-name]
        - Deletes the specified branch

    3. $ git merge [branch]
        - Combines the specified branch’s history into the 
          current branch. This is usually done in pull requests, 
          but is an important Git operation.

   4. $ git checkout [branch-name]
        - Switches to the specified branch and updates the 
          working directory




# Synchronize changes
    - Synchronize your local repository with the remote repository 
      on GitHub.com
    
    1. $ git fetch
        - Downloads all history from the remote tracking branches

    2. $ git merge
        - Combines remote tracking branch into current local branch

    3. $ git push
        - Uploads all local branch commits to GitHub

    4. $ git pull
        - Updates your current local working branch with all new 
          commits from the corresponding remote branch on GitHub. 
          git pull is a combination of git fetch and git merge





# Make changes
    - Browse and inspect the evolution of project files

    1. $ git diff [first-branch]...[second-branch]
        - Shows content differences between two branches

    2. $ git log --follow [file]
        - Lists version history for a file, including renames

    3. $ git log
        - Lists version history for the current branch

    4. $ git commit -m "[descriptive message]"
        - Records file snapshots permanently in version history

    5. $ git add [file]
        - Snapshots the file in preparation for versioning

    6. $ git show [commit]
        - Outputs metadata and content changes of the specified commit
