Superglobals in PHP

Some predefined variables in PHP are "superglobals", 
which means that they are always accessible, regardless
of scope - and you can access them from any function,
class or file without having to do anything special.


The PHP superglobal variables are:

    $GLOBALS
    $_SERVER
    $_REQUEST
    $_POST
    $_GET
    $_FILES
    $_ENV
    $_COOKIE
    $_SESSION
